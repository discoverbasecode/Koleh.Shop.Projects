Koleh.Shop.Projects

A modern, scalable, and maintainable web application built with ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs, embracing Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. This project implements CQRS using MediatR for clear separation of concerns, robust command/query handling, and a clean, testable codebase. It supports multiple databases (MongoDB, SQL Server, PostgreSQL) and leverages Entity Framework Core, FluentValidation, and AutoMapper for a production-ready solution.
üöÄ Key Features

Minimal APIs: Lightweight, high-performance endpoints using ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs.
Clean Architecture: Organized into layers for maintainability, testability, and scalability.
Domain-Driven Design (DDD): Implements Aggregate Root patterns to model complex business domains.
CQRS with MediatR: Separates read and write operations for better performance and clarity.
FluentValidation: Provides robust, declarative validation for inputs.
Multi-Database Support: Seamlessly integrates with MongoDB (NoSQL), SQL Server, and PostgreSQL using Entity Framework Core.
AutoMapper: Simplifies object-to-object mapping to reduce boilerplate code.
Modular & Extensible: Designed to easily accommodate new features and database providers.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs: For building fast and lightweight APIs.
Entity Framework Core: ORM for SQL Server and PostgreSQL database operations.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for flexible data storage.
MediatR: Implements CQRS and mediates commands/queries.
FluentValidation: Declarative and expressive validation rules.
AutoMapper: Efficient mapping between objects.
.NET 8.0: The latest .NET framework for modern development.
